In this paper we described a method for obtaining solutions to Laplace's equation with Neumann boundary conditions 
on polygonal domains given an accurate discretization of a corresponding Dirichlet problem. 
The resulting solutions are accurate in a 
``weak sense'', allowing evaluation of the solution at points which are located sufficiently far from the boundary of the 
domain. We then presented a method for using these ``weak solutions'' to obtain accurate solutions to the Neumann problem 
in an $L^\infty$-sense arbitrarily close to the corner in a computationally efficient manner. 

Though the present paper treats only Laplace's equation for polygonal domains, the method shown here extends 
much more broadly. In particular, the approach easily extends to accommodate curved boundaries. Moreover, in addition 
to Laplace's equation, this approach can be easily adapted to solve the Helmholtz equation and the biharmonic equation with analogous boundary conditions. A manuscript detailing this extension is currently in preparation.
